The smooth nature of the Gateron allows it to be triggered with very light force, making it effortless to type.\\n\u3010Gateron Red Switch\u3011\\nType: Linear\\nActuation Force: 45 gf\\nActuation Distance: 2.0 mm\\nTravel Distance: 4.0 mm\\nDescription: Gateron red is the most commonly used Gateron switch because it is a linear switch, making the typing sound quieter. The pressure is more moderate, light, and prolonged periods of typing will not feel tired.\\n\u3010Gateron Yellow Switch\u3011\\nType: Linear\\nActuation Force: 50 gf\\nActuation Distance: 2.0 mm\\nTravel Distance: 4.0 mm\\nDescription: The design of the Gateron yellow switch is the same as the red switch, but the departure strength is 5g bigger, which seems small but does offer a difference in feeling. The feedback of the yellow switch is more rigid, but it doesn\u2019t need heavy force to be triggered.\\n\u3010Gateron Black Switch\u3011\\nType: Linear\\nActuation Force: 60 gf\\nActuation Distance: 2.0 mm\\nTravel Distance: 4.0 mm\\nDescription: The black switch is a linear switch with the greatest strength amongst standard mass-produced switches. Those who like mechanical keyboards with a stronger trigger force will likely prefer the Gateron black switch.\\n\u3010Gateron Brown Switch\u3011\\nType: Tactile\\nActuation Force: 55 gf\\nActuation Distance: 2.0 mm\\nTravel Distance: 4.0 mm\\nDescription: Gateron brown switch has the characteristics of both the red and blue switches. The vertical press still feels smooth, but also has the feeling of a bump. The sound is relatively quiet and will not disturb the surrounding environment.\\n\u3010Gateron Blue Switch\u3011\\nType: Clicky\\nActuation Force: 60 gf\\nActuation Distance: 2.3 mm\\nTravel Distance: 4.0 mm\\nDescription: Gateron Blue has a unique clicky touch feel and a louder sound. It still has the characteristics of the Gateron Switch and is smooth with tactile feedback. This structure can let you type for a long period and not get tired. It\u2019s ideal for games and typing.\\n\u3010Gateron Green Switch\u3011\\nType: Clicky\\nActuation Force: 80 gf\\nActuation Distance: 2.3 mm\\nTravel Distance: 4.0 mm\\nDescription: Gateron Green switch is seen by many as an upgraded version of Gateron Blue switch. 80g of press force is 20g higher than the Blue switch. The green switch has stronger feedback and a harder rebound.",
